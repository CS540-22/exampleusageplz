The system architecture will consist of a backend with a MySQL database containing tables for user, content, API callee, and ratings data. There will be a central web service to interface API requests for OAuth, users, and content between the database and frontend. In addition, the backend will utilize World Of Code, dispatching jobs to mine usage examples from relevant repositories over time or on demand. The frontend will consist of a VSCode extension that will scan the editor for calls, and allow examples to be accessed via the “Code lens” functionality. To rate or submit content, users must authenticate. Users can configure authentication via settings. The user will be able to rate and browse contextually relevant code examples in a non intrusive manner. Users can submit posts by selecting code and using a context action in the editor.
