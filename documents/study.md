# User Study

## Pre-Survey

Get participants to state their confidence using a predetermined set of frameworks / tools. Optionally, participants can specify particular interest in a given framework / tool to use in the study. They should state the tool they are most familiar with, and their confidence in that tool, as well as a tool they are most interested in learning.

If the participant has no familiarity with any of the frameworks, tools, or languages present they will not move on to the next step.

Although the tool currently only supports typescript and javascript, the questions need not neccesarilly be using those languages.

### Example List of Frameworks presented in Pre-Survey

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.org/package/axios)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

### Scale of Confidence

* 0 Never used, or used only briefly
* 5 Used recently and often

## Survey Methodology

The survey will be conducted in one session. They will be given a warm up session with an easy task to familiarize themselves with the task.

Allow them to use the documentation provided by the tool to choose from a pool of snippets. Ask participants to rate their confidence in their selection. Note the time spent on the survey.

The participant will be surveyed again at a later date, and will undergo the same process but with example usage given in addition to the relevant documentation. 

The framework / tool selected should be:

* the framework / tool the participant indicates they are most interested in learning
    * failing that, a framework / tool they have used but are not intimately familiar with
* different than the previous selection
